Collection of arguments for Line 2.49.3

1) Line 2.49.3 and Line 9.31.2 were both selected for egg size (Large and Small respectively) simultaneously with the previously published Lines 2.46.4 and 9.17.1.  

2) Lines 2.46.4 and 9.17.1 both follow the framework established by Feng's 2008 Dev Cell paper;  B0 to Egg Length correlation is preserved when egg size limits are increased dramatically.  

3) Bicoid protein staining reveals that the length constant lambda is significantly increased  (144 um mut; 100 um wt) 

4) The level of Bicoid at the anterior tip (B0) in Line 2.49.3 is also noticably reduced.  

5) There is a 10% difference in nuclear number between Line 2.49.3 and 9.31.2; however the size is increased by (x%), and thus nuclear density is effectively decreased; confirmed by C.Miles in her Evolution paper using similarly selected lines.

6) One possible explanation is an alteration of Bicoid mRNA distribution; which is not properly represented as a point source as it is seen in many modelling papers.  It is more accurately described as a cloud whose localization is maintained at the anterior tip of the embryo both anchoring and retrograde action by a series of motor proteins/complexes working in concert.

6a) According to Feng's 2008 Dev Cell paper; the unpublished results suggest that the increased variablity in the Bicoid mRNA distribution of the staufen embryos can be linked to a slight increase in the length constant lambda (100 wt vs 105 stau)  {But what about relative lambda; ie, lambda/L?}


7) Ultimately, the conditions which must be explained are the increase in the length constant and the decrease in B0 as it relates to the increased egg size.  

8) The issue of precision also needs to be investigated.  The 'flatter' Bicoid gradient profile of Line 2.49.3 lends itself to an increased positional error as a result conversion from intensity errors according to Gregor (Cell 200x ?)
[Basically intensity fluctuations multiplied by the inverse local slope]

9) In Supplemental Figure S5 of Cheung et al. Development 2008, it shows that there is a larger amount of maternally deposited Bcd mRNA in larger embryos vs. smaller embryos;  this appears to have been established as a general rule as it was the case for 6 different populations (3 large and 3 small).  

9a)  While the data from Fig S5 cannot be shown again in the same manner; the raw data within it can be analzyed differently.  Namely, perhaps it may be the case that the distribution of the Bcd mRNA in the larger embryos can be measureably different than in the smaller populations.  Such that the larger total amount of Bcd mRNA is insufficietly relegated to the anterior tip and as a consequence the source of distribution of the Bicoid protein is significantly larger than in the smaller embryos [or disproportionate in some other fasion].  


10) Even-skipped data from C. Miles should also be included somewhere. 

10a)  Also included are Eve border positions from Lines 9.17.1 abd 2.46.4; the previously published Drosophila lines.
